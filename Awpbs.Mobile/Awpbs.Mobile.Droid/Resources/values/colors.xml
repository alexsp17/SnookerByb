<!--- These colors correspond to the colors from Config.cs
  RGB decimal values are converted into hex.

  Those three basic colors are used by Android Material Design theme.
  We override them with our own:
      primary:     ColorBackground = Color.FromRgb(37, 36, 36);
      primaryDark: ColorBackgroundLogo = Color.FromRgb(50, 50, 50);
      accent:      ColorRedBackground = Color.FromRgb(219, 54, 56);

  It might be better to set them at run time in onCreate instead, 
  so that they are only defined in one place - Config.cs

  This is just for experiment, I set the button background color at runtime
  in FacebookActivity. 
      byb_button_red:  ColorRedBackground = Color.FromRgb(219, 54, 56);
